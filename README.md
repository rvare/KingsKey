# Features

## Manage Passwords

Manage accounts and passwords with a simple and easy to use interface.

## Easily Copy Passwords

A simple dedicated button makes it easy to copy each password to your clipboard so you don't have to worry about mistyping your passwords when logging in to your accounts.

You can also copy other fields, like email and account name.

## Password Generation

Comes with a password generator that creates a string of random characters.

If you decide not use a password generator, a password strength indicator will tell you how strong the password you decide to use is, so that you don't end up using a password that's easily cracked.
